# Historical Context Overlays

## Overview

The Historical Context Overlays subproject is a part of the larger OpenDhamma initiative. It leverages Augmented Reality (AR) technology to provide immersive, educational experiences that contextualize the Dhamma within its historical and cultural background. By overlaying historical information onto real-world environments, this project aims to enhance understanding and engagement with key Buddhist sites and teachings.

## Vision

To deepen the understanding of the Dhamma by contextualizing it within its historical and cultural milieu, making the teachings more accessible, engaging, and educational through immersive AR technology.

## Objectives

1. **Develop Accurate Historical Overlays**: Create AR overlays that provide detailed historical and cultural information about significant Buddhist sites and texts.
2. **Interactive Learning Modules**: Design interactive modules that allow users to explore and interact with historical content in a meaningful way.
3. **Global Accessibility**: Ensure that the AR content is accessible to a wide audience, with support for multiple languages and devices.
4. **Scholarly Collaboration**: Collaborate with historians, archaeologists, and Buddhist scholars to ensure the accuracy and richness of the content.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update and refine the AR content based on user feedback and new historical findings.
