# Historical Context Overlays Project Overview

## Introduction

The Historical Context Overlays subproject aims to leverage Augmented Reality (AR) technology to provide immersive and educational experiences that contextualize the Dhamma within its historical and cultural background. By overlaying historical information onto real-world environments, we seek to enhance understanding and engagement with key Buddhist sites and teachings.

1. **Develop Accurate Historical Overlays**: Create AR overlays that provide detailed historical and cultural information about significant Buddhist sites and texts.
2. **Interactive Learning Modules**: Design interactive modules that allow users to explore and interact with historical content in a meaningful way.
3. **Global Accessibility**: Ensure that the AR content is accessible to a wide audience, with support for multiple languages and devices.
4. **Scholarly Collaboration**: Collaborate with historians, archaeologists, and Buddhist scholars to ensure the accuracy and richness of the content.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update and refine the AR content based on user feedback and new historical findings.
